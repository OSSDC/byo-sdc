# BUILD YOUR OWN SELF-DRIVING CAR

This repository will present the topic of retrofitting a hobbyist car for the purpose of driving autonomously, as well as collecting a number of resources for making that goal a reality.

* WHY?
  - Apply theory
    -  Move from working code to code that functions in real world conditions.
  - Less expensive, obviously
  - Safer, obviously
    - Crashing an RC car is not a catastrophic event
  - Real world beats canned video / Simulation
    - show Udacity Simulator vs Real-time live footage
  - Work with Sensors, micro controllers (want to experiment with Lidar/Radar/etc?)
    - Show possible sensors
  - Push the boundaries of Sensing, Perception and Control
    - "If everything seems under control, you’re not going fast enough."

* < $100
  - Simple Raspberry Pi Car Video
  - Slide about the simple car

* $150-500 (But still pretty affordable)
  - RPi/Arduino
  - Donkey
  - Android Robocar
  - MonsterBorg: https://www.piborg.org/monsterborg-preorder

* Advanced $1000+
  - Formula 1/10 (Great series of lectures in addition to plans for building car)
  - MIT RACECAR
  - BARC Project

* What Does it take
  - Car
    - Magnet 1/16 ~$90
    - Traxxas 1/10 ~$300
  - Sensors
    - Camera
    - Lidar
    - IR Depth Imaging
    - IMU (Inertial Measurement Units)
    - Radar, Sonar, etc.
  - Brain
    - Raspberry Pi (Zero or 3) - Cheap, but less powerful. Requires lightweight, efficient computation or else relaying sensor data to more powerful computer and sending steering and speed controls to car (but this also comes with its own tradeoffs… Latency)
    - Android (Android Robocar)
    - Nvidia Jetson Series - More powerful micro-controller for onboard computation
