# BUILD YOUR OWN SELF-DRIVING CAR

This repository will present the topic of retrofitting a hobbyist car for the purpose of driving autonomously, as well as collecting a number of resources for making that goal a reality.

## WHY?
  - Crashing an RC car is not a catastrophic event in the way that a full-size car crash is
    - While that's on obvious statement, what is perhaps less obvious is the fact that fear of catastrophic failure leads us to optimize for safety without really pushing the boundaries of what the technology can do.
  - Real world beats canned video / Simulation
    - Move from working code to code that functions in real world conditions. (Udacity Simulator vs Real-time live footage)
  - Democratize the technology
    - The architecture of a self-driving RC car is not in principle different from that of a full-sized vehicle. This puts the full autonomous vehicle architecture within reach of anyone who wants to learn. You now have the ability to work with the full menu of sensors, micro controllers, motors, etc.
    - Show possible sensors
  - Push the boundaries of Sensing, Perception and Control
    - "If everything seems under control, youâ€™re not going fast enough."
  - It's just fun!

## WHAT?
  - Car
    - Magnet 1/16 ~$90
    - Traxxas 1/10 ~$300
  - Sensors
    - Camera: visual perception
    - Lidar: spatial/depth perception with pulsed laser range sensors
    - IR Depth Imaging: spatial/depth perception using projected infrared light and camera
    - IMU (Inertial Measurement Units): measures and velocity and angular rate using a combination of accelerometers and gyroscopes
    - Radar, Sonar, etc.
  - Controller
    - The sensors are interfaced with a computer or computers, onboard and remotely via Wifi, which gather than sensor data and relay it to the software
      - Raspberry Pi (Zero or 3) - Cheap, but less powerful, often delegates perception and planning to another computer, such as a laptop
      - Nvidia Jetson Series - More powerful micro-controller for onboard computation
      - Android, Beaglebone, etc.
  - Software
    - Perception and planning algorithms process and combine the sensor data and send back steering and throttle commands to the car
